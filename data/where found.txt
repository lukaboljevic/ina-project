### Informational ###
    movielens_100k - https://networks.skewed.de/net/movielens_100k (smaller)
        bipartite:
        Left nodes are tags and right nodes are movies. An edge shows that a tag was applied to a movie.

    wordnet - https://networks.skewed.de/net/wordnet
        Node is a word, and edge denotes relationships between words (synonymy, hyperonymy, meronymy, etc.)

### Biological ###
    nematode_mammal - https://networks.skewed.de/net/nematode_mammal (~30k nodes)
        A global interaction web of interactions between nematodes and their host mammal species, 
        extracted from the helminthR package and dataset. Nodes are annotated with species-level 
        information. (multiple networks?)

### Social ###
    anybeat - https://networks.skewed.de/net/anybeat (smaller)
        Nodes are users and links represent friendships. 
        The edge direction (i, j) denotes the user i follows user j.

    enron.net - vaje 6, email network
        Node i links to node j if i sent at least one email to address j.

### Biological ###
    genetic_multiplex (Homo) - https://networks.skewed.de/net/genetic_multiplex (~18k nodes)
        Multiplex networks representing different types of genetic interactions, for different 
        organisms. Layers represent (i) physical, (ii) association, (iii) co-localization, (iv) 
        direct, and (v) suppressive, (vi) additive or synthetic genetic interaction. Edge direction 
        (i,j) indicates gene i interacting with gene j. (multiple networks?)

### Technological ###
    linux - https://networks.skewed.de/net/linux (smaller), not perfect
        A network of Linux (v3.16) source code file inclusion. 
        Nodes represent source files and a directed edge indicates if one file includes another.

    caida_as - https://networks.skewed.de/net/caida_as (~26k nodes, smaller, maybe better than linux?)
        A sequence of 122 network snapshots denoting Autonomous System (AS) relationships on the 
        Internet, from 2004-2007, inferred using the Serial-1 method from RouteViews BGP table 
        snapshots and a set of heuristics.

    nec.net - vaje 11, Internet overlay map

    python_dependency - https://networks.skewed.de/net/python_dependency (We already have a big 
    directed network for this domain, but could be useful) (~58k nodes)
        Python's package dependency networks. Nodes in the network are Python's packages registered 
        to PyPI and edges are dependencies among packages.

### Informational ###
    cora - https://networks.skewed.de/net/cora (smaller)
        If a paper i cites a paper j also in this data set, then a directed edge connects i to j.

    stanford_web - https://networks.skewed.de/net/stanford_web
        Nodes represent pages and directed edges represent hyperlinks between them.
